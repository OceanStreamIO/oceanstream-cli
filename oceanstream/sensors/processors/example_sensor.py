"""Example per-sensor processor.

This module illustrates how a concrete sensor implementation can
register itself with the sensor processor registry. It is wired to the
R2R metadata types but can be adapted for other providers as needed.

In real usage this file would be replaced or complemented by
domain-specific processors such as ``adcp.py``, ``ctd.py``, etc.
